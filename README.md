### About myself:

My name is William, I was born in Sydney, Australia. I am a 29-year-old mechanic currently living on the Gold Coast, Queensland with my wife and 2 children. I graduated high school in 2006, I have since completed a Certificate 3 in light vehicle automatic technology, and Certificate 3 in heavy diesel technology. I have recently decided to change career path and am pursuing a career in the financial services industry. I have completed my diploma of financial planning and am currently undertaking accreditation courses for compliance in providing advice on tier 2 financial products which I hope will get me into the industry and help make my current study of ‘Bachelor of business – financial planning’ a little more relatable. My Hobby that I absolutely love is online car simulator racing. I play on a title called ‘iRacing’ where I get the chance to race online against other people worldwide at any time of day. I have the full setup including a direct drive servo motor that I have mounted a Sparco steering wheel to. The wheel has a fully functional LCD telemetry screen, carbon fibre paddle shifters and 17 functional buttons. I use an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset whilst racing and the immersion is just incredible.  

### My interest in IT:

My interest in IT has always been there. Mainly from a gaming point of view but as I have grown, I have always been utilising IT for so many facets of life. When I was a teenager I spent most of my free time on the internet, whether it be on msn, listening to music, doing assignments, gaming, it was a massive part of my life, it is how I kept close with a lot of my friends and family who lived too far away to see on a regular basis. As I have grown, I have also utilised IT in every job I’ve ever had. When I worked at Kmart, we utilised handheld scanners that held the full inventory of the store, when I worked in a local IGA supermarket the POS systems were all touch screen computers with a pos software. Currently as a mechanic I utilise a multitude of internet-based programs for research, parts catalogues, specification listings and even our invoicing software works on a cloud server. We utilise diagnostic tools to interface with vehicle data signals which we rely on constantly. In all these uses of IT above I have purely a user’s knowledge. There has always been an intrigue to understand the workings behind the User interface and that is where my interest in IT is always triggered.
