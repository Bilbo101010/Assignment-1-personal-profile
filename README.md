Name: William Stevenson

Student I.D: S3756939

### About myself:

<p> My name is William, I was born in Sydney, Australia. I am a 29-year-old mechanic currently living on the Gold Coast, Queensland with my wife and 2 children. I graduated high school in 2006, I have since completed a Certificate 3 in light vehicle automatic technology, and Certificate 3 in heavy diesel technology. I have recently decided to change career path and am pursuing a career in the financial services industry. I have completed my diploma of financial planning and am currently undertaking accreditation courses for compliance in providing advice on tier 2 financial products which I hope will get me into the industry and help make my current study of ‘Bachelor of business – financial planning’ a little more relatable. My Hobby that I absolutely love is online car simulator racing. I play on a title called ‘iRacing’ where I get the chance to race online against other people worldwide at any time of day. I have the full setup including a direct drive servo motor that I have mounted a Sparco steering wheel to. The wheel has a fully functional LCD telemetry screen, carbon fibre paddle shifters and 17 functional buttons. I use an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset whilst racing and the immersion is just incredible.</p>  

### My interest in IT:

<p>My interest in IT has always been there. Mainly from a gaming point of view but as I have grown, I have always been utilising IT for so many facets of life. When I was a teenager I spent most of my free time on the internet, whether it be on msn, listening to music, doing assignments, gaming, it was a massive part of my life, it is how I kept close with a lot of my friends and family who lived too far away to see on a regular basis. As I have grown, I have also utilised IT in every job I’ve ever had. When I worked at Kmart, we utilised handheld scanners that held the full inventory of the store, when I worked in a local IGA supermarket the POS systems were all touch screen computers with a pos software. Currently as a mechanic I utilise a multitude of internet-based programs for research, parts catalogues, specification listings and even our invoicing software works on a cloud server. We utilise diagnostic tools to interface with vehicle data signals which we rely on constantly. In all these uses of IT above I have purely a user’s knowledge. There has always been an intrigue to understand the workings behind the User interface and that is where my interest in IT is always triggered.</p>


### Why did I choose RMIT University for my tertiary education?

<p>My reasons for enrolling in tertiary education at RMIT are varied. I have long been drawn to the allure of the financial sector. Well-dressed people, clean and organised workspaces and driven professional people have always been something that I have pictured myself being part of. My current employment is foreman, at my Father’s mechanical workshop on the Gold Coast. It has always been the intention for myself to take over the business upon my father’s retirement but in recent times with a young family, minimal free time and the example of my father’s six-day working week lifestyle to look forward to, I decided that it was time I make the leap into tertiary education and chase down my future aspirations. With a mortgage and a family to feed my only option was to undertake online study and using the internet I soon found myself enrolled in university.</p>

### What i expect to learn during my studies?

<p>During my studies I feel I will gain a wealth of knowledge in the world of finance and broader subjects in accounting, information technology and laws surrounding the industry. I hope to gain the edge above my peers with my determination and the subject matter provided by RMIT I hope to gain a wealth of knowledge that will serve me in my future career as a financial planner so I can provide top-notch advice to my clients. During this subject of Introduction to IT I expect to gain a deeper knowledge of the inner workings of programs beyond the user interface which is about as in-depth as I have ever looked thus far. I understand that tertiary education is a journey and an experience, some subjects will appeal to me whilst others will not. I will approach is with an attitude of knowledge is power and take as much knowledge as I can from the experience.</p>  

### My dream job:

<p>As i am studying Financial Planning my eventual ideal job will be to be a financial plannner. The main role of a financial planner is to essentially liase with people to get an idea of their financial situation and work out a plan to implent the best ways to utilise their finances, whether it be to increase savings, reduce debt, increase income through investments, minimise tax or even get the most out of government social security benefits.</p>

<img src="dream%20job.PNG" >

<p> This job appeals to me for many reasons. I enjoy the investigative role of finances, the annalysis of a client's situation, breaking down their income, their expenses, their financial position, thier goals and then devising a plan on how we can accomplish them is such an intrigueing process to me. It would be amazing to be able to put forward a plan and show how much of a difference their future outlook will be just by utilising my knoweldge. Travel, meeting high net worth clients, working in an industry of high achieving personel is another aspect of the finance industry that has drawn me in in recent years. </p>

<p> This role would require a high level of knowledge in a vast range of financial products. To be considered for this job an applicant would have to have spent many years in the financial advice sector. A job such as this would require the the appplicant to have tertiary education of either bachelor or masters level withing the business/finance subject area. The applicant would be a very accomplished planner who'm would have a diverse background in finance where he would have gained experience in areas of superannuation, investment vehicles, fixed interest products and risk protection products. To deliver advice on financial products one must be registered as a financial planner with ASIC and all other regulations that govern the industry. </p>

<p> My plan to get into contention for a position such as this would be to firstly gain administration experience within a financial planning firm. I have recently completed my Diploma of Financial planning and am on my way to becoming accredited in RG146 which is a requirement set out by ASIC to provide advice on tier1 financial products. By gaining these qualifications i have given myself the best possible chance to gain employment withing the financial planning industry without having any experience. Once in administration i can gain knowledge, customer service skills and prove my competence in handling and comprehending financial documentation, from here i will attempt to get promoted into a para-planner position which is a role which is basically a complete technical support to the financial planner. While the planner conducts the interview they make file notes and once the interview is over they bring their notes and a series of other investigative documents filled out by the clients to the para-lanning team. It is the para-planner who carry's out the annalysis of the clients situation, investigates suitable recommendations and researches suitable products to recommend to the client. The role is a massively technical and intriguing, this is where planners develop their skills and the ability to provide good advice to their clients. I would spend quite a few years in a paraplanning role where i cement my knowledge and make sure i can provide outstanding support to my adviser. From  here i would make the step up to an adviser role, I would use my previous skills in customer service, technical expertise and industry experience to cement my place in the industry as a reputable financial planner. </p>

<h3> What do these test results mean for me?</h3>

<p> These test results only prove what i already know about myself. Over the last few years i have spent quite a bit of time on getting to know what makes me... me. As a mechanic currently, i know that i am preferencial to tactile learning, i have struggled quite a bit with study throughout my diploma not attracting my attention as it was purely pdf files of information to read and hopefully retain the information which for a person like myself just doesn't interest me, meanwhile undertaking university with lectures and group conversations, i am much more stimulated. The creativity test score is also fairly correct. I am a person who likes to find solutions to problems within the bounds of my skills. I don't tend to make up silly things, I utilise my knowledge to achieve practical compromises. The result of the 16 personalities teset would also confirm that I am on the right path going into finance, i like being assertive and using my knowledge whilst also pushing myself and really enjoy interacting with people and having meaningful conversations. </p>

<h3>How the results will influence my ability to work in a team </h3>

<p> These results show that in a group environment I am likely to initate a direction, I am likely to state my opinions and have a fair amount of say in the final product. I am likely not to do the tedious research but will play a hand in the building of the concept and the final product. I may have to colaborate with the team to grasp the theory behind the task as i will learn more through explanation than i probably would reading instructions but i will be able to work well with my peers and provide energy to the team environment.</p>

<h3> How should i take this into account when forming a team? </h3>

<p> I would need to make sure that i'm in a group with outgoing people, I thrive on interaction and having a few silent partners would lead to them feeling overrun by myself and may lead to discontent within the group as their opinions will likely not be heard. </p>

<h1> My project idea </h1>

<h3> Overview:</h3>

<p> The idea is to create a modified design for the oculus rift headset which would add the ability to flip up the screen of the headset via a hinged mount on the goggles. A few programable led lights will be fitted inside the headset that will interface with a program that is run on the pc that the rift will be connected to. The program will use external sensors and cameras to track the user’s position within the room whilst also monitoring things such as the door to the room so that it can show that someone has entered which will set off the LED lights within the headset so that the user understands there is something that requires their attention in the real world environment. </p>

<h3> Motivation behind the project</h3>

<p> Virtual reality headsets are becoming common place amongst pc users looking for that extra bit of immersion. In 2019 alone there have been 6million virtual reality headset sold worldwide (Statista 2019). I, personally use an Oculus Rift whenever I race on my simulator, it is an amazing experience inside the headset, but it can be a very awkward experience when trying to interface with factors that are outside the virtual environment. I want to make the user experience better by making the transition from virtual world to real world a little simpler as my experience has shown, it is not just a case of once the headset is on, the real world can't interact with the user, it is just a surprise when it does. <p>
 
<h3> Description </h3>

The main task of the project is to create a modified headset for the Rift. The headset modification will encompass a hinged screen section so that the user can flip up the screen in the headset so that they can transition to viewing the real-world environment without needing to remove the headset. This is a major concern whilst interfacing with any game that has more functionality than what the touch controllers provide the user e.g. log in screens and in game messaging functionality. With the modification to the headset we will also include an LED light or RGB strip into the headset above the screen, this screen will act as a warning system to the user for specific issues that a user is faced with form the real-world environments. Things like a family member entering the room without your knowledge, a pet making its way into the ‘play zone’, something in the room that is potentially hazardous that you would not have picked up before entering the headset. Firstly, there is need for some form of microswitch or sensor that would notify if someone or something entered the room. This would transmit to a Raspberry pi which would illuminate a flashing LED that would warn the user that someone was coming into their play area. The user could then displace an earpiece and converse with the person without fully leaving the virtual world and without getting the ‘fright of their life’. Another function that would ideally be implemented is the use of the oculus sensors to interface with the raspberry pie so that when the user is moving too close to the edge of the play area not only would the virtual safe zone be displayed but a flashing warning would be displayed that would emphasise the danger. </p>

<p> The LED’s function within the headset would support third party software developers, especially those within the sim racing genre. I feel that if the simulator software could interact with the raspberry pie, things such as yellow warning flags, green flags and blue/yellow flags could be displayed via the LED lighting or the RGB lighting strip which would add to the experience and immersion for the client as the graphical detail can be lacking and small details such as flags waving can often be missed. </p>

<p>The interface to the software should include a full RGB lighting chart and have programmable customisable settings for different commands such as strobing, flashing, constant glow, how bright the lighting should be and possibly even have an audible warning that is pushed through the computer’s onboard sound that would be triggered when someone enters a room. It could also be handy for voice activation of certain function and the setting of a ‘Turn off LED system’ command which would stop the LED system working if it was no longer wanted/needed at that time. </p>  

<h3> Tools and technologies: <h3>
<p> The hardware needed to carry out this project would include:
<ul>
<li> 1x raspberry pi </li>
<li> Multi-coloured LEDs or RGB lighting strip </li>
<li> cable to link Raspberry pi to Lighting strip/LEDs </li>
<li> Wireless motion sensor, Microswitch, or door beam sensor. </li>
<li> Casing for Raspberry pi (possible custom enclosure) </li>
<li> 3d printed replacement rift enclosure which would utilise the original straps </li>
</ul>
</p>
 
<p> The software required to function the LED interface and the sensors would be open source from the internet. LED lighting and sensors are often used withing the robotics applications of the Raspberry pi, so there should be a solution easily available that could be modified for interfacing with third party applications.</p>

<h3> Skills required:</h3>

<p> This project would require a team with good programming skills utilising 'Python' code language and skill with windows coding  to help interface third party softwares. There would also be an element of design and fabrication to modify the original headset design or to create a completely new housing. The project wouldn't require extensive design or coding but could face issues in implementing interfaces with the oculus sensors and third party softwares. I would imagine most software writers would be able to set up the basic warning lights and RGB coding and with further knowledge should be able to interpret the backend of gaming titles to provide flagging data etc. </p>

<h3> Outcome: </h3>

<p> The outcome of the project will be to give the user a much more seamless transition between being in the headset and being able to view the real-world environment by utilising the flip up screen mount and not having to remove the complete headset or lifting it up. By utilising the LED strip inside and the programed warnings the user will be able to avoid awkward shocks when someone or something enters the room without their knowledge. Overall this project wil remove some of the most exasperating and displeasing issues that arise from the utilisation of a virtual reality headset such as the Oculus Rift and increase the pleasure of using such a fantastic piece of technology. </p>
