### About myself:

My name is William, I was born in Sydney, Australia. I am a 29-year-old mechanic currently living on the Gold Coast, Queensland with my wife and 2 children. I graduated high school in 2006, I have since completed a Certificate 3 in light vehicle automatic technology, and Certificate 3 in heavy diesel technology. I have recently decided to change career path and am pursuing a career in the financial services industry. I have completed my diploma of financial planning and am currently undertaking accreditation courses for compliance in providing advice on tier 2 financial products which I hope will get me into the industry and help make my current study of ‘Bachelor of business – financial planning’ a little more relatable. My Hobby that I absolutely love is online car simulator racing. I play on a title called ‘iRacing’ where I get the chance to race online against other people worldwide at any time of day. I have the full setup including a direct drive servo motor that I have mounted a Sparco steering wheel to. The wheel has a fully functional LCD telemetry screen, carbon fibre paddle shifters and 17 functional buttons. I use an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset whilst racing and the immersion is just incredible.  

### My interest in IT:

My interest in IT has always been there. Mainly from a gaming point of view but as I have grown, I have always been utilising IT for so many facets of life. When I was a teenager I spent most of my free time on the internet, whether it be on msn, listening to music, doing assignments, gaming, it was a massive part of my life, it is how I kept close with a lot of my friends and family who lived too far away to see on a regular basis. As I have grown, I have also utilised IT in every job I’ve ever had. When I worked at Kmart, we utilised handheld scanners that held the full inventory of the store, when I worked in a local IGA supermarket the POS systems were all touch screen computers with a pos software. Currently as a mechanic I utilise a multitude of internet-based programs for research, parts catalogues, specification listings and even our invoicing software works on a cloud server. We utilise diagnostic tools to interface with vehicle data signals which we rely on constantly. In all these uses of IT above I have purely a user’s knowledge. There has always been an intrigue to understand the workings behind the User interface and that is where my interest in IT is always triggered.


### Why did I choose RMIT University for my tertiary education?

My reasons for enrolling in tertiary education at RMIT are varied. I have long been drawn to the allure of the financial sector. Well-dressed people, clean and organised workspaces and driven professional people have always been something that I have pictured myself being part of. My current employment is foreman, at my Father’s mechanical workshop on the Gold Coast. It has always been the intention for myself to take over the business upon my father’s retirement but in recent times with a young family, minimal free time and the example of my father’s six-day working week lifestyle to look forward to, I decided that it was time I make the leap into tertiary education and chase down my future aspirations. With a mortgage and a family to feed my only option was to undertake online study and using the internet I soon found myself enrolled in university.

### What i expect to learn during my studies?

During my studies I feel I will gain a wealth of knowledge in the world of finance and broader subjects in accounting, information technology and laws surrounding the industry. I hope to gain the edge above my peers with my determination and the subject matter provided by RMIT I hope to gain a wealth of knowledge that will serve me in my future career as a financial planner so I can provide top-notch advice to my clients. During this subject of Introduction to IT I expect to gain a deeper knowledge of the inner workings of programs beyond the user interface which is about as in-depth as I have ever looked thus far. I understand that tertiary education is a journey and an experience, some subjects will appeal to me whilst others will not. I will approach is with an attitude of knowledge is power and take as much knowledge as I can from the experience.  

### My dream job:

As i am studying Financial Planning my eventual ideal job will be to be a financial plannner. The main role of a financial planner is to essentially liase with people to get an idea of their financial situation and work out a plan to implent the best ways to utilise their finances, whether it be to increase savings, reduce debt, increase income through investments, minimise tax or even get the most out of government social security benefits.
